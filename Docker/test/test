What Is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. 

When you have to deal with a lot of resources, source code, or binary files in computer science you usually use packages. And when you have to deal with a lot of packages you need a package manager. In the system world, you can use APT to install Debian binaries or applications or YUM to install RPM packages. If you are a Java developer, you use Maven to build and deploy your artifacts. As a JavaScript developer, you use npm to install your Node modules or pip if you develop in Python. 

In the Kubernetes world we have the same. The packages are called charts. There are a bunch of Kubernetes resource definitions, the YAML files. And Helm is the package manager to manage those charts.
